# Learning Latent Geometries

**Project Guide:** 
+ Prof Søren Hauberg

Latent variable models, such as the variational autoencoder, suffer from the identifiability problem: there is no unique configuration of the latent variables. This is problematic as latent variables are often inspected, e.g. through visualization, to gain insights into the data generating process. The lack of identifiability then raise the risk of
misinterpreting the data as conclusions may be drawn from arbitrary latent instantiations.

In this project we investigated a geometric solution to the
identifiability problem that amounts to endowing the latent space with a particular Riemannian metric. You learnt about latent representations and computing geodesics accordingly.
